---For security reasons, get_clipboard() only has access to the host clipboard after ctrl-v is pressed while Picotron is active. Until ctrl-v is pressed, changes to the host clipboard have no effect on the return value of get_clipboard(). The same is true for sandboxed applications (e.g. bbs carts): they are only able to access clipboard contents from other processes once ctrl-v is pressed while that app has keyboard focus.
